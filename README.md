# ig_tracker
Mini Instragram account tracker. 

This tracker uses the instagrapi (API) to login and fetch informations about an account from command line. It also uses python gui. Through manipulation of the returned account information, we can gain valuable insights that we other wise couldn't, such as checking accounts not following you back. This project was discontinued due to repeated 
logging in to personal accounts through API triggering meta's account safety lock. Acquiring testing accounts
for developers is necessary for the future continuation of the project.
